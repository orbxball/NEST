NEST Protocol 2.0 version development plan

As of now, the NEST Protocol 1.0 version has been online for 10 months, and in September of this year, the open source work of the core contract code. In the past 10 months, we have witnessed the development of the NEST project. At the same time, we also found some problems in this process, including mining algorithm level, contract structure level, and authority system level. and many more. As you can see, as a new protocol-level decentralization project, NEST is still in the research and development stage and is not so perfect. For the long-term sustainability of the NEST ecosystem, and in response to the issues already discovered on the NEST Protocol, and in conjunction with the NestCore team's in-depth understanding of the nature of the blockchain, we decided to develop the NEST Protocol version 2.0. In the NEST Protocol version 2.0, we will adjust and optimize the NEST system to make it more secure, scalable, open, and more decentralized. The specific adjustment content has the following four parts:

Part 1: Adjustment of NEST mining algorithm

When many people are using (mining), NEST mining efficiency will decrease; when NEST usage is reduced, NEST mining efficiency will increase; in other words: NEST mining difficulty will be dynamically adjusted, and There is no longer a fixed base mining cost value.

Part 2: Adjustment of the NEST release mechanism

For the long-term development of the NEST ecosystem, we need NEST to have a good first- and second-tier market. Therefore, we will make some adjustments in the NEST release mechanism: when each transaction is successful, NEST will not be released immediately, but will be released gradually within a certain period. Simple understanding: the number of NESTs we get will not decrease, but only delayed release.

Part 3: Adjustment of the amount of dividends in the community

In order to solve the problem of excessive fluctuation of NEST dividend yield, we will make some adjustments to the NEST dividend mechanism: each period will draw a certain proportion of income for saving, in case of a period of insufficient income to complete. In this way, NEST holders can ensure a relatively stable expected rate of return and better promote the stable and sustainable development of NEST.

Part 4: New voting system

In order to further decentralize NEST, the NEST Protocol 2.0 version will add a voting system. The changes to the core parameters will be changed by NEST voting, and each NEST holder has voting rights.

The above is the core content of the NEST Protocol 2.0 to be adjusted. After completing the online work of the NEST Protocol version 2.0, the open source work of the protocol layer code will be carried out and the developer documentation will be released. At this point, the NEST protocol was officially opened to the public, and third-party developers were encouraged to develop their own DeFi products based on the NEST Protocol to build a NEST ecosystem and consensus!

Development upgrade cycle: It is estimated that 1 month, the NEST Protocol 2.0 version will be completed before the end of November this year.

In the process, I hope everyone can maintain a positive communication with NestCore. We are confident that we will complete the development work as planned to ensure that the NEST Protocol 2.0 version goes live.
